<p>I personally have had two dogs in my family that I've known. They are both Cairn Terriers.<br/>
Dogs have always been apart of my life and I really enjoy spending time around and with them. If coastal allowed me to have a dog, I'd have one.
I personally think dogs are the best animals on the planet. I feel that dogs deserve the best treatment and hate when they are mistreated. </p>

<p>This is my dog Maria. She died about two years ago. She was a year younger than my older sister, so she grew to be about 15 years old.
We were extremely lucky she lived as long as she did. <br/>She had a lot of medical problems near the end of her life but she stayed with us for a lot longer than the doctors expected.</p>
<h3>Brandi</h3>

<p>This is my puppy brandi. She is just over a year old and she is very playful and loves to dig up my backyard.
We got her from a breeder in West Virginia. So far she's destroyed every single toy we've given her within a week.
She loves to pick out the white stuffing and leave it all over the house. Brandi is a very loving dog. </p>
